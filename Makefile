# Something weird is causing Eclipse to be sad after a clean, but a 2nd build does the trick
# It looks like Eclipse checks "what should I build", then does the pre-build, and then builds,
#  so things created by the pre-build go "under the radar" until the 2nd build.
# As of January 2018, this might be an unresolved low-priority CDT bug, not going to be fixed soon?
#
# Doing "Project -> Clean", and then two builds usually works, except
#  that it doesn't always know to that a "clean project" should re-run flex and bison,
#  which I'd like it to do.
#
# KLUDGE: Make things depend on Debug/util.o, so that a make clean will (eventually) trigger it
#         (see setting and use of REBUILD_AFTER_CLEAN variable above)
# Note that this means occasional unnecessary re-bisoning/re-flexing, but it's better than
#   failing to re-run those steps when we actually wanted a clean.
# Note furthermore that REBUILD_AFTER_CLEAN must be something that does not include
#   any of the things generated by the pre-build step, or we'll always rebuild them.
# If I could figure out how to have Eclipse do a pre-clean step, that would be even better.
